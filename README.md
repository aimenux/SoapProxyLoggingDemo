Logging soap requests/responses in xml
```

> In this repo, i m using a [custom endpoint behavior](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/extending/how-to-inspect-or-modify-messages-on-the-client) in order to log soap requests/responses in xml. This can be useful for debug and testing purposes.
